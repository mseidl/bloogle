Open source blog using google app engine

Overview:

This blog is very simple, and not *quite* ready to be used... but close.  You could actually start blogging now, but there are some security issues that need to be resolved.

Before running, there is a variable 'ecv' that gets added to hmac when hashing cookie values.  This is commented out, you need to pick out a value to use.
